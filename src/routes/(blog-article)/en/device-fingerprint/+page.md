## Your Digital Fingerprint is Your Identity!
> ***Many details about you are undoubtedly being exploited without your knowledge. Websites and data processing organizations (often referred to as big data) assign you a unique identifier by aggregating information such as:***

<Callout type="warning">

> - Your IP address
 - The websites you visit
 - The accounts you use
 - Your contact lists
 - What you search for
 - Your language and time zone
 - Your operating system, browser, configuration, and screen resolution
 - Your browsing times and frequencies
 - Your conversation topics and everything you exchange on less privacy-respecting services (communications, cloud, â€¦)
 - And more.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Your **IP address** allows for geolocation and identifying your civic identity, `but even if you try to hide it, aggregating all this information makes it almost certain to identify you`. 

For this **"digital identity"**, we refer to ***web fingerprinting***. This is also why using a VPN often proves to be futile and redundant.

# Why Does This Matter?

<Callout type="info">

*This information **(your information)** is mainly used to create your consumer profile, potentially sell it directly to advertisers, or more generally provide targeted advertising services.*

> *Information leaked from your activities can also be used for more malicious purposes, such as facilitating phishing attacks. For instance, by offering a fake login page for a bank to its users.*

</Callout>

<Callout type="success">

*The pursuit of anonymity aims to hide as much of this private information as possible, which is legal since privacy is a fundamental right for every individual!*

</Callout>

## Cookies, JavaScript

<Callout type="info">

* **Cookies** are data that websites store on users' computers and can later access. This generally allows adding useful features for the user. For example, the site `my-open-source-blog.com` uses **cookies** to enable users to log in automatically or to retain dark mode preferences.*

</Callout>

<Callout type="error">

*But in the context of scripts `(code executed on the client-side)` provided by a `GAFAM` on a regular site, **cookies** facilitate the identification and tracking of users. `The GAFAM` places a unique identifier on the browser and obtains extensive information about web history, habits, interests, and user preferences.*

</Callout>

> This identification is not only valid for the web but for all types of proprietary mobile, desktop, Android/Apple TV applications,...

## What Should You Do?

> You need to first become aware of your digital identity and your actions on the web, as every digital device has its own identity (as explained earlier). It is important to understand that some proprietary services do not always aim to protect your interests, and your personal data has significant value.
