# What Does It Mean to Be Open Source?
<Callout type="info">

 *Being **Open Source** means that the source code of a software is open and accessible to everyone. This allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code. This transparency promotes collaboration and innovation, as developers worldwide can contribute to improving the software. Additionally, open source software is often considered more secure because its code is regularly audited by the community, allowing vulnerabilities to be quickly detected and fixed. By using open source software, users benefit from the freedom to customize tools to their needs and the confidence that the software does not contain hidden or malicious features.*

</Callout>

## Transparency and Trust

> One of the main advantages of using open source software is the complete transparency of its source code. Unlike **proprietary software**, whose code is often hidden behind intellectual property barriers, open source software makes its code available for anyone to inspect, modify, and improve. This transparency allows users and developers to verify for themselves the presence of vulnerabilities or unwanted features, such as spyware or malware.

<Callout type="success">

*Moreover, the speed of updates is another key advantage. In the open source world, security patches are often deployed much more quickly than in the realm of **proprietary software**.*

</Callout>

## Enhanced Security

> When the code is open, it is accessible to everyone for examination and testing. This visibility allows security experts to scrutinize the code meticulously to identify potential flaws and fix them quickly. For example, open source projects like Linux are constantly subjected to independent security audits, ensuring continuous and rigorous oversight.

<Callout type="success">

*Open source applications offer enhanced security thanks to the transparency of their code, allowing a vast community of developers to quickly detect vulnerabilities and eliminate malware. Most importantly, they have a store (the equivalent of a Play Store) where each application is verified.*

</Callout>

## Freedom and Customization

> Open source software offers unparalleled freedom by allowing users to modify and adapt the source code to their specific needs. This customization capability means you can adjust the softwareâ€™s features to perfectly match your requirements, whether it's adding functionalities or optimizing performance.

<Callout type="success">

*Unlike **proprietary software**, where modifications are often limited or impossible, **open source** gives you complete control over the tool you use. This flexibility fosters better integration with your other systems and applications.*

</Callout>
