# Why Degafamize Yourself?
#### First, what is a Gafam?
<Callout type="info">
  <h5>The GAFAM is an acronym that refers to the five most influential and dominant tech giants in the digital sector. These companies are Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon,...</h5>
</Callout>

> *These companies have a major influence on technology, digital culture, and the global economy, often due to their size, global reach, and control over a large portion of the population's digital services and data.*

## So why should I do it?
###### For several reasons:

- Protection of Privacy
<Callout type="info">
The GAFAM are known for collecting large amounts of data on their users for advertising and profiling purposes. They then sell your data to other companies without your consent.
</Callout>
<Callout type="success">
By disengaging from these services, you reduce the amount of personal information collected and stored.
</Callout>

- Increased Security

<Callout type="info">
Large companies are often major targets for cyberattacks due to the large amount of data they hold.
</Callout>
<Callout type="success">
By choosing alternatives like open-source or decentralized services, you greatly reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
</Callout>

#### Profiling and Advertising

<Callout type="info">
 The GAFAM use sophisticated algorithms to deliver targeted ads based on your online behavior. They create digital profiles for each individual, which they then use for commercial purposes, manipulation, and more.
</Callout>

>*“Those who control today's algorithms control tomorrow's individuals.”*

<Callout type="success">
By leaving these giants' ecosystems, you eliminate profiling based on your online activities and preferences, telemetry from your devices, and analysis of your personal data.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
It is good to know that behind these free services, there is invisible work serving these giants. Each device connected to these services:

- Regularly sends data about its state (telemetry)
- Geolocates you permanently
- Your **documents, images, videos, etc.** are analyzed by third-party services without your consent
- Scans Wi-Fi networks **(SSID)** and Bluetooth devices around you to feed their databases *(which allows better location tracking even without GPS!)*
- And many other things that I won't elaborate on here!

</Callout>

<Callout type="error">

*Many **GAFAM** constantly violate the privacy of millions of people without their consent. By collecting, analyzing, and sharing personal data on a large scale, these digital giants compromise users' privacy and autonomy. These practices, often opaque and intrusive, expose individuals to increased risks of surveillance, manipulation, and privacy violations. It is crucial to recognize the importance of protecting our personal information and choosing more privacy-respecting alternatives to regain control over our data.*
